Lists of things for a fully featured web application

- Creating a beautiful interactive UI for users to give them a better feel about the application.
- Giving users a flexibility to add few fields to check out more information other than just foodtruck's name and location.
- Adding logging tools to understand the usage of the user.
- Analysis of this data would help in getting a much better understanding about scaling the application.
- Caching would help improve the performance by reducing the amount of requests.
- If a lot of users starting using the service, a load balancer could help distributing the load on different servers. 
- Add test cases to check if the client side is working properly or not.
