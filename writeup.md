Lists of things to consider for a fully featured web application

- Creating a beautiful interactive UI for users to give them a better feel about the application.
- Giving users the flexibility to add a few fields to check out more information other than just foodtruck's name and location.
- Adding logging tools to understand the usage of the user.
- Analysis of this data would help in getting a much better understanding of scaling the application.
- Caching would help improve performance by reducing the number of requests.
- If a lot of users starting using the service, a load balancer could help in distributing the load on different servers. 
- UI could also consist of images of the foodtrucks and these images could be stored on a CDN for better performance.
- Add test cases to check if the client side is working properly or not.
